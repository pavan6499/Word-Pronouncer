- Update Google app and Google Text-to-Speech

**Chrome Users:**
- Chrome often provides access to Google's online voices
- Ensure internet connection for best voice quality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Voice Not Working:**
- Check browser permissions for audio
- Ensure speakers/headphones are connected
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console (F12) for voice information

**No Indian Accent:**
- Check console logs to see which voice is being used
- Install language packs on your system
- Try different browsers (Chrome recommended)

**Words Not Splitting Properly:**
- The algorithm handles 100+ common words with custom splits
- Less common words use intelligent splitting rules
- Complex words may need manual pronunciation practice

**Audio Cutting Off:**
- Increased timeouts should prevent this
- Try slower speech rate
- Check system audio settings

### Debug Information:
Open browser console (F12) to see:
- Which voice is being selected
- Available voices on your system
- Speech synthesis status
- Error messages if any
